    Microsoft ResX Schema 
    
    Version 2.0
    
    The primary goals of this format is to allow a simple XML format 
    that is mostly human readable. The generation and parsing of the 
    various data types are done through the TypeConverter classes 
    associated with the data types.
    
    Example:
    
    ... ado.net/XML headers & schema ...
    <resheader name="resmimetype">text/microsoft-resx</resheader>
    <resheader name="version">2.0</resheader>
    <resheader name="reader">System.Resources.ResXResourceReader, System.Windows.Forms, ...</resheader>
    <resheader name="writer">System.Resources.ResXResourceWriter, System.Windows.Forms, ...</resheader>
    <data name="Name1"><value>this is my long string</value><comment>this is a comment</comment></data>
    <data name="Color1" type="System.Drawing.Color, System.Drawing">Blue</data>
    <data name="Bitmap1" mimetype="application/x-microsoft.net.object.binary.base64">
        <value>[base64 mime encoded serialized .NET Framework object]</value>
    </data>
    <data name="Icon1" type="System.Drawing.Icon, System.Drawing" mimetype="application/x-microsoft.net.object.bytearray.base64">
        <value>[base64 mime encoded string representing a byte array form of the .NET Framework object]</value>
        <comment>This is a comment</comment>
    </data>
                
    There are any number of "resheader" rows that contain simple 
    name/value pairs.
    
    Each data row contains a name, and value. The row also contains a 
    type or mimetype. Type corresponds to a .NET class that support 
    text/value conversion through the TypeConverter architecture. 
    Classes that don't support this are serialized and stored with the 
    mimetype set.
    
    The mimetype is used for serialized objects, and tells the 
    ResXResourceReader how to depersist the object. This is currently not 
    extensible. For a given mimetype the value must be set accordingly:
    
    Note - application/x-microsoft.net.object.binary.base64 is the format 
    that the ResXResourceWriter will generate, however the reader can 
    read any of the formats listed below.
    
    mimetype: application/x-microsoft.net.object.binary.base64
    value   : The object must be serialized with 
            : System.Runtime.Serialization.Formatters.Binary.BinaryFormatter
            : and then encoded with base64 encoding.
    
    mimetype: application/x-microsoft.net.object.soap.base64
    value   : The object must be serialized with 
            : System.Runtime.Serialization.Formatters.Soap.SoapFormatter
            : and then encoded with base64 encoding.

    mimetype: application/x-microsoft.net.object.bytearray.base64
    value   : The object must be serialized into a byte array 
            : using a System.ComponentModel.TypeConverter
            : and then encoded with base64 encoding.

&lt;li&gt;You will only use the wireless communication services for customary purposes and in compliance with law, and will comply with any policies, rules or guidelines communicated to you by us, including safe driving and health and safety guidelines.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br&gt;

&lt;li&gt; The wireless communication services are provided on an “as is” and “as available” basis. Your use of the wireless communication services is at your sole risk. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Both we and the underlying carrier are not responsible for and shall not have any liability to you for (a) libel, slander, defamation or the infringement of copyright arising from material or messages transmitted over our telecommunications network or that of the underlying carrier or recorded on our equipment or that of the underlying carrier; (b) damages arising out of your act, default, neglect or omission in the use or operation of equipment activated on our telecommunications networks or those of the underlying carrier; (c) damages arising out of the transmission of material or messages over our telecommunications network that of underlying carrier on your behalf which is in any way unlawful; or (d) any act, omission or negligence of other companies or telecommunications systems in relation to the provision of the wireless communication services when the facilities of such other companies or telecommunications systems are used in establishing connections to or from facilities and equipment controlled by you. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When roaming outside of the underlying carrier’s coverage area, you are responsible for all applicable charges, and are subject to the terms and conditions of service (including limitations of liability) imposed by the wireless service provider providing the roaming services. Charges for roaming calls may be billed in the months after the calls were made. &lt;/li&gt; &lt;br&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You will indemnify us and the underlying carrier against all manner of actions, claims, damages, liabilities and judgments (including legal fees and courts costs) (collectively, “&lt;b&gt;Claims&lt;/b&gt;”) sustained by or made against us or the underlying carrier by a third party in connection with the use of our fleet tracking and management solution or the wireless communication services by you or any other person including any Claims sustained by or made against us or the underlying carrier arising out of or in connection in any way with your inability or the inability of any other person to use the wireless communication services or any failure or interruption of the wireless communication services.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You must read all collateral materials concerning service and use of the equipment, including, without limitation, any welcome guide, plan brochures, coverage maps, and materials related to equipment and accessories and any additional printed materials and consumer information specified by the underlying carrier from time to time, including any acceptable use policy, which may be found at the underlying carrier’s website.

&lt;li&gt;The underlying carrier collects information about the approximate location of equipment in relation to its cell towers and the Global Positioning System (“&lt;b&gt;GPS&lt;/b&gt;”). The underlying carrier uses that information, as well as other usage and performance information also obtained from its network and the equipment, to provide the services and to maintain and improve its network and the quality of the wireless experience. The underlying carrier may also use location information to create aggregate data from which your personally identifiable information has been removed or obscured.

It is your responsibility to read the information and the associated privacy policy for each Location-Based Service to learn how the location information will be used and protected. You may refer to the underlying privacy policy at the underlying carrier’s website for additional details. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;br&gt;

&lt;li&gt; We may terminate the provision of wireless communication services to you without notice or any further obligation or liability if the agreement with our underlying carrier governing the provision thereof expires or terminates.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If our agreement with an underlying carrier or a reseller thereof is terminated, you may be able to continue the provision of services, provided however that such continued provision may be subject to such underlying carrier’s or reseller’s then-current terms and conditions.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;br&gt;
&lt;li&gt; The underlying carrier and/or its reseller is a third party beneficiary of these terms, and may take any equitable or legal action required to enforce same.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;br&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We may change, modify or amend these terms at any time in accordance with the terms of the Agreement, provided however the notice period applicable will be 15 days.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;br&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
