Street-level data includes the United States; much of Canada; Japan; most countries in Europe; parts of Asia; Australia and New Zealand; parts of South America including Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Columbia, and Venezuela; and parts of southern Africa including Botswana, Lesotho, Namibia, South Africa, and Swaziland.\n\nThis comprehensive street map includes highways, major roads, minor roads, one-way arrow indicators, railways, water features, administrative boundaries, cities, parks, and landmarks, overlaid on shaded relief imagery for added context. The map also includes building footprints for selected areas in the United States and Europe. Coverage is provided down to ~1:4k with ~1:1k and ~1:2k data available in select urban areas. \n\nThe street map was developed by Esri using Esri basemap data, DeLorme basemap layers, U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) elevation data, Intact Forest Landscape (IFL) data for the world; NAVTEQ data for Western Europe, Australia and New Zealand, North America, South America (Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Columbia, Venezuela), and parts of southern Africa (Botswana, Lesotho, Namibia, South Africa, and Swaziland); and TomTom data for parts of Africa (Mozambique and Zimbabwe), select countries in Eastern Europe (Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Belarus, Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, Moldova, Montenegro), and select European island nations (Cyprus, Faeroe Islands, Iceland, and Svalbard/Jan Mayen Islands).
